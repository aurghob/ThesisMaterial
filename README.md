# ThesisMaterial
1. The intermediate files that were generated while working on ProPara are present here.<br/>
2. Arindam's(@ari9dam) [ILPME system](https://github.com/ari9dam/ILPME) was run on top of the final_relations3.zip to generate the learned.txt file. <br/>
3. propqasrl.zip contains all the input files that were consumed by the [QA-SRL]( https://github.com/aurghob/nrl-qasrl) system(propara branch).<br/>
4. qastupleslower.txt contains all the (verb, question, answer) pairs combined after parsing the propbank sentences through QA-SRL.<br/>
5. proptupleslower3.txt contains all the extracted (verb, role, sentence fragment) pairs extracted from the propbank dataset.<br/>
6. fintupleslowerfinal.txt combines qastupleslower and proptupleslower3 to have (verb, question, role, sentence fragment) pairs - Not really used in the end.<br/>
7. propbank.bk contains the actual combination of qastupleslower.txt and proptupleslower3.txt to have (verb, question, role) pairs.<br/>
8. learnedmodified285.txt contains rules generated by modifying rules in learned.txt by modifying text according to rules in propbank.bk. Used 85% fuzzy matching of the fuzz.ratio from the [fuzzy libary](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) to replace strings. <br/>
9. learnedmodified285a.txt contains rules appended to learned.txt by modifying text according to rules in propbank.bk.<br/>
10. The other learned modified files contain similar files but use 90% fuzzy matching.<br/>
